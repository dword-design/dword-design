### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸŽ‰

I'm Sebastian Landwehr, a freelance web developer from Bonn in Germany.

My passion is all about JavaScript, especially related to client-side development. Most projects I'm developing are based on Vue.js and Nuxt.js, which allows me to use the whole tech stach from server to client. I'm also heavily into open source development and I'm contributing lots of packages in the NPM world.

When I'm developing apps, I prefer to use Firebase as a BaaS.

Besides programming, I'm writing songs, playing guitar and singing at concerts or karaoke sessions. I'm also into deep discussions, philosophy, psychology, and good movies.
